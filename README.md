# SERM

This is the code of CIKM 17 short paper: "SERM: A Recurrent Model for Next Location Prediction in Semantic Trajectories".

## About
In this repository, we propose a RNN-based model, namely SERM, to predict next location of LBSN users. SERM considers both squencial relations and semantic influence to generate the prediction result. 

## Files
There are four python files in the root path.
